# Georgia-RealEstate-Price-Prediction

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
This project revolves around predicting the prices of real estate properties in Georgia using a specialized model created with python. By analyzing various factors, such as location, property features, and market trends, the model can estimate the price of a property accurately.

Predicting real estate prices helps in many ways:

 * Investors use predictions to buy or sell properties wisely, earning more money.
 * People looking to buy or sell a property know the expected price, which helps them negotiate better.
 * Individuals and businesses plan their property investments and budgets better by knowing what prices might be in the future.
 * Predicting prices helps cities plan better roads, buildings, and taxes, which helps the economy grow.
